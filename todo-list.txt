Program structure:
1. split the functions to files(Green's function, configuration fast-update)

The steps of this algorithm(and the contents need to be implemented)
1. generate the configurations and weights(by matrix determinant)

what we need(for each beta): configuration({tau, s}), weight

to rewrite the move construction function for MatrixLapack

assume we already have the input data({tau, s} -> weight)
we should train a linear regression model with mJ, mL, mF

todo: add assert to polynomial.hpp Polynomial::[]
